# First Principles Policy Template
As is becoming more and more obvious, thought is relative. We must not assume that everyone in the world starts thinking from the same place. This template allows platforms and organizations to be easily transparent about the assumptions they make about their users and the world by publishing a "first principles policy" similar to that of a privacy policy or Terms Of Service (TOS). This will allow both individuals and organizations to be on the same page about how your services are designed and impact every aspect of their life.
