# First Principles Policy Template
As is becoming more and more obvious, thought is relative. We must not assume that everyone in the world starts thinking from the same place. This template allows platforms and organizations to be easily transparent about the assumptions they make about their users and the world by publishing a "first principles policy" similar to that of a privacy policy or Terms Of Service (TOS). This will allow both individuals and organizations to be on the same page about how your services are designed and impact every aspect of their life.

## Structure

The template is organized into separate Markdown files for each major section, providing a modular and customizable structure. Users can easily adapt and expand upon each section based on the specific beliefs and assumptions of their organziation.

## Usage

To use this template for your organization:

1. Review the content of each section and customize it to reflect your organization's values and assumptions.
2. Modify or create additional sections as needed to cover specific aspects relevant to your organization.
3. Organize the sections to align with your preferred structure and priorities.
4. Utilize the provided placeholders and instructions for a seamless customization process.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance and refine the First Principles Policy template are welcomed. If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional sections that could benefit the template, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
